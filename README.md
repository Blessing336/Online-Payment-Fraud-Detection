# Online Payment Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict online payment fraud, enhancing the security of online payment systems.

## Project Structure

### 1. Data Inspection
Conducted a thorough examination of the dataset to understand its structure, identify missing values, and gain insights into the characteristics of the data.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses to explore relationships within the data.

### 3. Feature Engineering
Created new features and transformed existing ones to improve the model's predictive performance.

### 4. Model Selection
Considered various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and XGBoost, selecting based on performance metrics.

### 5. Training and Validation
Trained the selected model on a labeled dataset using cross-validation techniques.

### 6. Model Evaluation
Evaluated model performance using precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.

### 7. Model Tuning
Fine-tuned hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance.


## Results
The final model achieved a 98% recall for identifying fraudulent cases and a 99% precision for minimizing false positives.


## Future Work
Future work may include obtaining additional labeled data, exploring advanced feature engineering techniques, and experimenting with deep learning models for improved performance.
